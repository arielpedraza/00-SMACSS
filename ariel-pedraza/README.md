##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Anything that targeted only a HTML element (shows in red in atom) and only modified text or color I moved to the base css. Then I moved anything that dealt with margin, padding, floats to layout css. This required me to split some identical blocks into both files only keeping the lines that belonged.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(Put your answer here)
